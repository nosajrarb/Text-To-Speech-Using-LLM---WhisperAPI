# Text-To-Speech-Using-LLM---WhisperAPI
Audio-Text And Summarization Into Bullet Points . This requires an LLM running locally on your machine, for my case I used llama3.2:1b. For more info, read requirements.txt
This is the backend of my project called BullScribeAI [Bull = Bullets, Scribe = Transcribe].
It transcribes an audio file of any format into text, and also summarises the audio file into concise bullet points.
You could also use an API key for the LLM by modifying the code, but I found running a light model like llama3.2:1b running locally on your machine most conveninent.
